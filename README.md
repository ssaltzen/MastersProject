# AI-r Force Maneuvers 

This repository contains the work for the final project of ECS 271 and the basis for the Master's Capstone Project of Siena Saltzen and Lukas Moehlebrock. 
The project is based on the AIA Maneuver Identification Challenge where in an effort to enable AI coaching and automatic maneuver grading in pilot training, the Air Force seeks to automatically identify and label each maneuver flown in this dataset from a catalog of around 30 maneuvers. 
We have approached a subset of this challenge for our class project. More Details about our work and methods are available in the documentation section in the provided reports.


## General Info

This project is still under development:

### 1. The Data
    *The Data set comes from the AI Accelerator Distribution
		* Motivation | https://maneuver-id.mit.edu
		
		* Data | https://maneuver-id.mit.edu/data
		
		* Info | 2.89GB/6,661 files of .tsv files containing aircraft positional/orientation over various intervals

    * Due to the privacy and confidential nature of the data, we are not released to share the actual files. 
		All files are store locally on the developerâ€™s computers.
	
### 2. Current State of the Project
    * The dataset has been clean and modified to remove bad files and inaccuracies
    * We have created several visualizations for testing and verification purposes
    * There are several clustering algorithms with different degree of success
	* There are additional methods currently in progress including and HMM classifier
	
### 3. Next Steps
    * Streamlining and fine tuning the current classifiers
	* Adapting the results of unsupervised learning to use as base for some self supervised approaches
	* Picking the most successful maneuvers to implement in a real time classifier


## The Code

#### - DataManagment ~ Contains files used to clean, validate and manage the dataset
	vistutorial.py ~ Graphs a file of maneuver data in a 3D plot for visualization
	rename.py ~ Early attempt at consistent file sorting, randomness, and quality control without central hosting
	getvaluesfrommaneuvers.py ~ Splits the files into singular "maneuvers" based on delineations of "steady flight"
	
#### - Clustering ~ Classifiers for unsupervised learning
	dtw.py ~ Dynamic Time Warping Classifier
	
#### - ManeuverVis ~ Unity Project that allows 3D manipulation and visualization of flight paths in files

#### - Documentation ~ Collection of code documentation, project reports, and reported results

#### -  HMM ~ Hidden Markov Model ~ Still in progress
